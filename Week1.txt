Basics:
1.Choose the Training Experience(TRAINING DATA) **
2.Choose the Target Function(That is to be learned)
3.How to represent he target function **(Class of FUnctions)
4.Chooose the learning Algorithm

Types of Learning:
1.Supervised **(Will have input & corresponding output data)
2.Unsuperivised (Will have the input the data that will be grouped into some catageories)
3.Semisupervised (Combination of Supervised & Unsupervised)
4.Reinforcement

SUPERVISED LEARNING:
---------------------
Types:
1.Classification(Discrete i.e., either true/false or 0...n)
2.Regression(Continous values say output is real valued number)
Example data:
X1 X2 ......Xn | Y(OUTPUT for input instances)
===================
a1 a2 ......an | Y1
b1 b2 ......bn | Y2
.................           TRAINING  DATA
.................
W1 W2 ......wn | Yn
----------------------
Z1 Z2 ......Zn | ??         TEST DATA

Classification Learning:
1.Task T (input & output)
  Input  : Input instances a1,b1,...w1(Here the set data a1,a2,...an are called features of task/instances)
  Output : Output instances Y1,Y2...Yn (i.e., 0/1 or true/false or 0...9 etc.,)
2.Performance Metric P
  Used to measure the error in predicting the output
3.Experience E
Types of Class of functions i.e., the type of algorithm used to learn the data
1.Decision Tree
2.Linear Function
3.Multi variate Linear
4.Single layer perceptron
5.Deep Neural Networks

Terminology:
1.Features : Distinct traits that are used describe each item/instance in training data
2.Feature Vector : n-dimensional vector used to represent the FEATURES of an object i.e., instance in training data
3.Instance spaceX: All the training data comprising of feature vector 
4.Example (x,y) : y =f(X)
5.Concept C: subset of objects from x
6.Target Function: Maps instance x to Y 
7.Training Data
